            <p>I find it very admirable that this small company with only 4 developpers was able to
                make such an awesomw game that everyone loves and has been waiting for it for so long, even if we did
                have to wait 7 years, but it's definetly worth the wait.</p>
            <p>And the music and animation for the game are an exceptional work given how small the team  is.</p>
            <p>Plus you can see how the community is very respectcful and supportive towards their work, since this game has no anti-pirating but no one is even willing to play that version and even wanting to pay more than the original price.</p>    
            <p>This inspires me to also do my best so that one day maybe I could also make a small group and create something awesome as well.</p>
