            <h2>Why I choose this course</h2>
            <img src="../Photos/HZ.png" alt="HZ" class="img">
            <p>I chosse HBO-ICT programme mainly for the software engineer so I can learn how to code better but I also
                like the fact that it doesn't only focusses solely on one subject, having also data science.</p>
            <p>Plus we get to have interships which is very helpful to gain more expirience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Some things I would like to do is develop my own games and websites for myself and to help make it
                    for
                    clients.</li>
                <li>Maybe in the future I could find a team to create seomthing cool or learn a 3D programms so I could
                    design things as well.</li>
                <li>If things go well in these few years, maybe I'll look for some part time jobs, so I can gain more
                    expirience and meet new people.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h2>Here you can see what I am able to do</h2>
            <p> When I was at at highschool I took a course about <strong>Architecture</strong> and <strong>Civil
                    engineering</strong></p>
            <p>Even thought it might not be what I want to persue, it still wasn't a bad choice, since I enjoyed it and
                got to learn interesting things like Descriptive Geometry and drawing program called Autocad</p>
            <img src="../Photos/Autocad.jpg" alt="autocad" class="img">
            <p>I was also lucky to have an intership related to that, so I was able to have some professinal expirience
                working in that kind of field</p>
            <p>Apart from school I also have an understanding of how to manage small events and I've also have
                participated in activities which required a good communication and teamwork.</p>
